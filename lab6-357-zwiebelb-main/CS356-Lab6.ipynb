    "Your goal is to train a model (can be logistic regression, but can be something else appropriate that we have not covered) to predict if a person will default on their loan or not, based on the information given. You may use the column(s) of your choice to build your model. Report your accuracy score of your model, using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing: Decide what columns you will use, clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features if necessary.\n",
    "2. Feature Selection: Select relevant features from the dataset that could be predictive of loan default. These could include variables such as income, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, employment status, and other financial and personal characteristics of borrowers.\n",
    "3. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, train a logistic regression model using the training data. In logistic regression, you're essentially fitting a linear regression model to the log-odds of the probability of loan default.\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained logistic regression model using the testing data. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis. Explain results.\n",
    "5. Model Interpretation: Interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of different features on the probability of loan default. Identify which features are most predictive of default.\n",
    "6. Model Deployment: If the model performs well and meets your requirements, you can deploy it to make predictions on new data or integrate it into a larger application or system (we will not do this, but write up a brief hypothetical scenario for how you might deploy your model at the bank you hypothetically work at)"
